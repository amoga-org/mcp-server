# Amoga Studio MCP Server

**MCP Server for Amoga Studio integration with Claude Desktop**

A powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables seamless integration between Claude Desktop and Amoga Studio's low-code application development platform. This server provides comprehensive tools for creating, managing, and deploying applications with advanced features like RBAC, automation, and AI-powered code generation.

## Quick Setup (No Clone Required)

Add this server to your Claude Desktop configuration by adding one of the following configurations:

### Using npx (Recommended):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "amogastudio": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "amogastudio"],
      "env": {
        "AMOGA_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Using uvx:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "amogastudio": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["amogastudio"],
      "env": {
        "AMOGA_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your Amoga Studio API key.

## Manual Setup (For Development)

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the server:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Using with Claude Desktop

The server provides two tool categories:

### **Legacy Tools** (Backward Compatibility)

- `create-app`, `get-apps`, `delete-app`
- `create-object`, `create-sot`, `delete-object`
- `create-update-roles`, `create-attributes`
- `add-dummy-data`, `publish-app`, `check-publish-status`

### **V1 Tools** (Modern & AI-Enhanced)

- **`createAppV1`**: Streamlined application creation
- **`createSOTV1`**: Objects with attributes and SOT processing
- **`createRoleV1`**: Advanced RBAC with intelligent permission mapping
- **`createAutomationV1`**: AI-powered automation generation
- **`publishV1`**: Simple application publishing

## Example Usage

Once configured, you can interact with the server through Claude Desktop with natural language:

### **Application Management**

- "Create a new application called 'Inventory Management System'"
- "Show me all my applications"
- "Get the contract details for app ID 12345"

### **RBAC Setup**

- "Create roles for my app: Admin with full access, User with read-only access to products"
- "Set up RBAC permissions where Manager can create and update orders but cannot delete them"

### **AI Automation**

- "When a new order is created, send email to the customer and create a follow-up task"
- "Create automation that generates PDF invoice when order status changes to completed"

### **Object Creation**

- "Create a Product object with name, price, category, and stock quantity fields"
- "Add status workflow to Task object: Todo ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Completed"

The server handles authentication automatically using the provided API key and provides intelligent suggestions based on your application contract.
