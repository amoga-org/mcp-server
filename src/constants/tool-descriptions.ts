  CREATE_APP:
    "Create a new application and update the backend system.\n\n" +
    "📋 REQUIRED WORKFLOW: When creating an app, follow this exact sequence:\n" +
    "1. CREATE_APP - Creates the basic application structure\n" +
    "2. CREATE_ATTRIBUTES - Define custom attributes for objects (optional but recommended)\n" +
    "3. CREATE_OBJECT - Create objects using the defined attributes\n" +
    "4. GET_APP_CONTRACT - Fetch application contract to understand structure\n" +
    "5. CREATE_UPDATE_ROLES - Set up user roles and permissions for the objects\n" +
    "6. PUBLISH_APP - Publish the application to make it available\n" +

    "8. GET_APP_CONTRACT - Re-fetch contract after publishing (for SOT and dummy data)\n" +
    "9. CREATE_SOT - Define status transitions and workflows\n" +
    "10. ADD_DUMMY_DATA - Add test data to objects (only for 'master' and 'object' type objects)\n\n" +
    "⚠️ IMPORTANT: Each step depends on the previous one. Steps 7-8 ensure the app is fully published before proceeding with SOT and dummy data operations.",

  GET_APPS: "Get all applications for a tenant",

  DELETE_APP: "Delete an application from the backend system",

  GET_APP_CONTRACT:
    "Step 4 & 8 in app creation workflow: Fetch all objects in an app contract and their details. " +
    "⚠️ Run after CREATE_OBJECT (step 4) and again after CHECK_PUBLISH_STATUS confirms publishing is complete (step 8).\n\n" +
    "First run (Step 4): Provides essential contract data for CREATE_UPDATE_ROLES to understand object structure and permissions.\n" +
    "Second run (Step 8): Re-fetches the updated contract after publishing to ensure CREATE_SOT and ADD_DUMMY_DATA have the latest object configurations, status maps, and attribute definitions. " +
    "This tool MUST be run before using CREATE_UPDATE_ROLES, CREATE_SOT, and ADD_DUMMY_DATA to ensure proper understanding of the application structure and object configurations.",

  CREATE_OBJECT:
    "Step 3 in app creation workflow: Create structured objects like workitems, tasks, and masters with attributes, statuses, and defined relationships. " +
    "⚠️ Run after CREATE_APP and CREATE_ATTRIBUTES, before CREATE_UPDATE_ROLES.\n\n" +
    "This tool lets you model business entities (e.g., workflows, data objects, master lists) by specifying fields, lifecycle states, and how objects relate to each other. " +
    "⚠️ Relationship Rules: " +
    "Only two relationship types are supported: oneToMany and manyToOne. " +
    "A task can be related to a workitem using only one task → workitem relationship. " +
    "Only two relationships are allowed between object types.",

  CREATE_SOT:
    "Step 7 in app creation workflow: Create SOT (Status Origination Tree) for all origination types. " +
    "⚠️ Run after PUBLISH_APP as the application must be published first.\n\n" +
    "⚠️ PREREQUISITES: \n" +
    "1. PUBLISH_APP must be run first to make the application available\n" +
    "2. GET_APP_CONTRACT will be automatically run first to understand object structure if not already done\n\n" +
    "The SOT defines how and from where an object's status can change. Each transition is linked to an origination source. " +
    "Supported origination types include:\n" +
    "• workflow - Status changes through workflow processes\n" +
    "• automation - Automated status transitions based on rules\n" +
    "• actions - Manual action-triggered status changes\n" +
    "• template_email_whatsApp - Status changes via email/WhatsApp templates\n" +

    "• page - UI page interactions (requires widget layout generation)\n" +
    "• navbar_and_roles - Navigation and role-based status changes\n" +
    "• dashboard - Dashboard-based status transitions\n\n" +
    "🖥️ PAGE ORIGINATION TYPE - SPECIAL HANDLING:\n" +
    "When `origination_type` is set to `page`, the AI must auto-generate a **UI page layout** for the target object. The layout should include a relevant set of widgets under the `widgets` property. " +
    "- `record`: All widgets applicable to the object type are allowed (e.g., header, iframe, comment, activity, jsonform, attachments, etc.), including `stats` and `table` if appropriate.\n" +
    "- `dashboard`: Only `stats` and `table` widgets must be included. No other widgets are allowed.\n" +
    "⚙️ Widget Auto-Generation Rules:\n" +
    "- If object type is `workitem` or `task`, include:\n" +
    "  • header, iframe, comment, activity\n" +
    "- If object type is for display (e.g., `object`, `master`), include:\n" +
    "  • header, table, filter, stats, jsonform\n" +
    "- If collaboration is needed, include:\n" +
    "  • comment, note, attachment, conversation\n" +
    "- If automation or tracking is involved, include:\n" +
    "  • automationLogs, eventLog, progressbar, taskIframe\n" +
    "- For advanced or custom UI, optionally include:\n" +
    "  • customComponent, container, richTextEditor, carousel, qrscanner, calendar, map, chart, json\n" +
    "🧩 Grid Layout Auto-Generation:\n" +
    "Each widget must include a `grid_props` object for layout control. The AI must auto-generate these dynamically based on widget type and available space.\n" +
    "- Default layout values:\n" +
    "  • w: width (max 12)\n" +
    "  • h: height (calculated based on widget type — 1 grid unit = 14px, so total height in px ÷ 14 = h)\n" +
    "  • x, y: position on grid (auto-calculated to prevent overlap)\n" +
    "  • isResizable: true\n" +
    "  • static: false\n" +

  DELETE_OBJECT: "Delete an object from the application contract",

  CREATE_UPDATE_ROLES:
    "Step 5 in app creation workflow: Create and update RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) roles for an application. " +
    "⚠️ Run after GET_APP_CONTRACT (step 4) and before PUBLISH_APP (step 6).\n\n" +
    "⚠️ PREREQUISITE: GET_APP_CONTRACT must be run first (step 4) to fetch the complete app contract and understand object structure, status maps, and attribute configurations. " +
    "This tool allows you to define roles with specific permissions for each object in the app. " +
    "Each role must have a unique `loco_role` identifier at the app level, a `display_name` for UI display, " +
    "and `loco_permission` which maps object slugs to permission sets. " +
    "Default permissions include: pick, read, assign, create, delete, update, and release. " +
    "If objects are not present in the app, default roles will be created automatically.",

  CREATE_UPDATE_ATTRIBUTE:
    "Step 2 in app creation workflow: Create custom attributes for objects in the application. " +
    "⚠️ Run after CREATE_APP and before CREATE_OBJECT.\n\n" +
    "⚠️ IMPORTANT: The following system attributes are reserved and should NOT be created as they are automatically managed by the system: " +
    "'status', 'priority', 'Due Date', 'name', and 'assignee'. Attempting to create these will result in an error. " +
    "\n\nThis tool allows you to define custom fields with specific display names, component types, component subtypes, and unique keys. " +
    "Each attribute will be created with auto-generated unique slugs to prevent conflicts. " +
    "Supported component types: enumeration (enumeration, multiselect), text (string, text, uuid, password, email, comment, instruction, title, Container, richText), number (integer, biginteger, float), boolean (toggle, checkbox), date. " +
    "The component_subtype must match one of the valid values for the selected component_type category.",

  ADD_DUMMY_DATA:
    "Step 10 in app creation workflow: Add AI-generated dummy data to tables based on object schema and attribute types. " +
    "⚠️ Run after CREATE_SOT as the final step in app setup.\n\n" +
    "⚠️ PREREQUISITES:\n" +
    "1. All previous steps (1-9) must be completed successfully\n" +
    "2. CHECK_PUBLISH_STATUS must confirm publishing is complete\n" +
    "3. GET_APP_CONTRACT must have been re-run after publishing to fetch updated contract\n\n" +
    "⚠️ AUTO-FETCH CONTRACT: If GET_APP_CONTRACT hasn't been run recently, it will be automatically executed first to fetch the complete app contract and understand object structure, status maps, and attribute configurations. " +
    "⚠️ OBJECT TYPE RESTRICTION: This tool ONLY works with 'master' and 'object' type objects. It will skip workitems, tasks, and other object types.\n\n" +
    "Then generates realistic test data using the contract's object maps for status and priority values (loco_name). " +
    "Generates realistic test data for each attribute while respecting system attributes. " +
    "⚠️ Note: System attributes (status, priority, Due Date, name, assignee) will be populated using appropriate values from the contract's object maps, falling back to default values if not defined.",

  PUBLISH_APP:
    "Step 6 in app creation workflow: Publish an application using the app ID and base URL. " +
    "⚠️ Run after CREATE_UPDATE_ROLES and before CHECK_PUBLISH_STATUS.\n\n" +
    "This will initiate the application deployment process and make the application available for use. " +
    "After publishing, you must run CHECK_PUBLISH_STATUS to monitor and ensure all components are successfully deployed " +
    "before proceeding with SOT (Status Origination Tree) creation and dummy data generation.",

  CHECK_PUBLISH_STATUS:
    "Step 7 in app creation workflow: Check if application publishing process is completed by monitoring deployment status. " +
    "⚠️ Run after PUBLISH_APP and before re-running GET_APP_CONTRACT.\n\n" +
    "This tool checks the publication status of various app components (App_meta, Datastore, Forms, Workflow, Pages, Automation) " +
    "by polling the API endpoint up to 20 times every 30 seconds until all components show completion status.\n\n" +
    "Status Values:\n" +
    "• 'completed' - Component is successfully deployed\n" +
    "• 'not_started' - Component deployment hasn't begun\n" +
    "• '' (empty string) - Component is completed (shown as 'completed' to user)\n" +
    "• 'failure' - Component deployment failed\n" +
    "• 'in_progress' - Component is currently being deployed\n" +
    "• 'queued' - Component is waiting to be deployed\n\n" +
    "The tool returns the final status and indicates whether the entire application publishing process is complete. " +
    "Publishing is considered complete when all component statuses are one of: 'completed', 'success', 'not_started', '' (empty), or 'failure'. " +
    "⚠️ NEXT STEPS: Once publishing is complete, run GET_APP_CONTRACT again to fetch the updated contract, then proceed with CREATE_SOT and ADD_DUMMY_DATA.",

  GENERATE_WORKFLOW:
    "Generate and deploy workflows for workitem-type objects ONLY, then automatically publish the application. " +
    "This tool creates CMMN (Case Management Model and Notation) workflows specifically for objects with type 'workitem' and deploys them to the Flowable engine.\n\n" +
    "Process:\n" +
    "1. Fetches app contract to get app name and workitem objects (if not provided)\n" +
    "2. Validates that objects are workitem-type (type: 'workitem') only\n" +
    "3. Generates CMMN XML for each workitem object based on the object structure\n" +
    "4. Deploys the workflow to Flowable engine via multipart form upload\n" +
    "5. Saves workflow configuration data to the application level\n" +
    "6. 🚀 AUTOMATIC PUBLISHING: If all workflows are generated successfully, automatically publishes the application\n\n" +
    "⚠️ PREREQUISITES:\n" +
    "• Application must have workitem-type objects created (type: 'workitem' ONLY)\n" +
